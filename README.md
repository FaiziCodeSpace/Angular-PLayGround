# Angular Learning Playground  

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering **Angular** through small, focused projects and experiments.  

## Purpose  
- Practice Angular step by step.  
- Test different features like components, signals, forms, routing, etc.  
- Build confidence before moving on to real-world AngularJS/Angular projects.  

## Current Progress  
- Signals demo with value updates and a counter example.  
- More small experiments will be added as learning continues.  

## Future Plans  
Once I am confident with Angular, I will upload more **real-world projects** to this repository.  

## Note  
This repo is for **learning purposes only** and may contain simple or experimental code.
